I started my journey in tech in 2019. Back then, I was very unfamiliar with tech.  Following years turned me from a novel to a tech enthusiast. 
Now, I love to learn about new technologies, make new connections and strive for the excellence of society with the help of technology. 
I believe to contribute to society in I need to be skilled with the best possible tech and soft skills. 
So I never miss out on the opportunities that can turn me into a better self. I see the MLH fellow one of them.
For me, it is a great opportunity to become a part of a international program from which 
I will not only benefit myself but also bring my experiences and learning to my fellows and grow better. 
I believe in helping others grow and grow with the help of others and the MLH fellowship seems to give me chance for both.
